## üöÄ How to Use This Guide

### For Interview Preparation:

1. **Start with Fundamentals**: Begin with `01_numpy_pandas.py` to ensure strong foundation
2. **Implement First**: Try coding algorithms yourself before looking at solutions
3. **Understand the Math**: Make sure you can explain each step
4. **Practice Variations**: Modify parameters and test edge cases
5. **Time Yourself**: Practice implementing key algorithms within interview time constraints

### During Interviews:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Always ask about input format, edge cases, and expected output
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with brute force, then optimize
3. **Think Aloud**: Explain your reasoning as you code
4. **Test Your Code**: Run through examples and edge cases
5. **Discuss Complexity**: Mention time and space complexity

## üí° Key Interview Tips

### Problem-Solving Approach:
```python
# 1. Understand the problem
# 2. Work through examples
# 3. Code a simple solution
# 4. Test and debug
# 5. Optimize if needed
# 6. Analyze complexity
```

### Code Organization:
```python
# Always structure your code clearly:
import necessary_libraries

def helper_function():
    """Document your functions"""
    pass

class YourSolution:
    """Use classes for complex implementations"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize parameters
        pass
    
    def main_method(self):
        # Core logic here
        pass

# Test with examples
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test your implementation
    pass
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Forgetting edge cases (empty arrays, None values)
- Numerical instability (overflow, division by zero)
- Inefficient nested loops when vectorization is possible
- Not validating input assumptions
- Overcomplicating simple problems

## üîß Environment Setup

```bash
# Required libraries
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
pip install torch torchvision  # For deep learning

# Optional but recommended
pip install jupyter notebook  # For interactive development
pip install pytest  # For testing your implementations
```

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

When implementing algorithms, aim for these performance targets:

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Linear Regression | O(n¬≤p) training | O(np) |
| Decision Tree | O(n¬≤p) training | O(nodes) |
| K-Means | O(nkdi) | O(nk) |
| Neural Network | O(n¬∑m¬∑h¬∑e) | O(parameters) |

Where: n=samples, p=features, k=clusters, d=dimensions, i=iterations, m=batch_size, h=hidden_units, e=epochs

## üéØ Interview Success Checklist

Before your interview, make sure you can:

- [ ] Implement key algorithms without looking at references
- [ ] Explain the math behind each algorithm
- [ ] Discuss pros/cons and when to use each method
- [ ] Handle edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Optimize for both time and space complexity
- [ ] Write clean, readable code quickly
- [ ] Debug efficiently when things go wrong

## üìö Additional Resources

- Review probability and linear algebra basics
- Practice on platforms like LeetCode (for coding) and Kaggle (for ML)
- Mock interview with peers
- Review recent papers for GenAI topics

**Remember**: The goal isn't just to memorize implementations, but to understand them deeply enough to adapt and explain them in any interview scenario. Good luck! üöÄ
