## üöÄ How to Use This Guide

### For Interview Preparation:

1. **Start with Concepts**: Each file begins with explanatory functions that cover key interview topics
2. **Review Implementations**: Study the simplified implementations to understand core algorithms
3. **Practice Explanations**: Use the explanation functions to practice articulating concepts
4. **Run Demonstrations**: Execute the demo functions to see concepts in action
5. **Focus on Understanding**: These implementations prioritize clarity over complexity

### During Interviews:

1. **Explain Concepts**: Use the explanation functions as templates for interview responses
2. **Show Understanding**: Demonstrate knowledge of key concepts rather than complex implementations
3. **Discuss Trade-offs**: Be ready to discuss when to use different approaches
4. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on clear, working solutions rather than over-engineered code

## üí° Key Interview Tips

### Problem-Solving Approach:
```python
# 1. Understand the problem and requirements
# 2. Explain your approach before coding
# 3. Start with a simple, working solution
# 4. Test with examples
# 5. Discuss optimization opportunities
# 6. Mention time/space complexity
```

### Code Organization:
```python
# Keep it simple and readable:
import numpy as np

def explain_concept():
    """Explain key concepts clearly"""
    print("Key points to remember...")

def simple_implementation():
    """Core algorithm implementation"""
    # Clear, working code
    pass

def demonstrate_usage():
    """Show practical application"""
    # Example usage
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run demonstrations
    pass
```

### Common Interview Topics:
- **Algorithms**: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means, Neural Networks
- **Concepts**: Bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, cross-validation
